# Project Karman Avionics System
The avionics system for the Northeastern University AIAA Project Karman rocket.

### Getting Started

Download Cygwin, Git Bash, or some other command line interface (Bash for Windows 10, etc.)

Create a folder on your computer. For example,
~~~
Documents/Karman
~~~

Navigate to this directory in the comand line interface. If you are using Cygwin or Git Bash,
this means typing 
~~~
cd ~/Documents/Karman
~~~
Where ~ means "My home directory" (C:\Users\<username>"), and cd means "change directory".

Enter the command:
~~~~
git clone https://github.com/AIAANortheastern/karman-avionics.git
~~~~

This will "clone" the git repository to your computer. If you are using Git Bash, you will see a nice
blue parenthetical next to your current directory that says "master".

TODO
Create a branch: Tyler pls fill this in kthx.


### Good practices

If you commit something that doesn't compile, I will find you, and I will make you fix it until it does.
